Claymore is a video game about one weak female warrior in a strange hostile world. It is based on the Claymore TV series universe. We aim for a big world, rich tactical and role-playing freedom, and a strong incentive to explore it and proceed to reach the final goal.

Technically, the game is written in Rust. Graphics uses OpenGL core profile, and the models are exported from Blender. The project is in its infancy, so both the goals and instruments may change.
